## Features
- Loot Balls can contain up to a stack of an item inside. **Objects are obtained by right clicking on the pokeball**.
- To set-up a loot, you need to be in **creative mode** and **right-click on the loot ball with the item or stack of an item in your hand**.
- Loot Balls can be invisible. In **creative mode**, right-click on the loot ball with your **empty hand**.
- Loot Balls can be **waterlogged**.
- Players have an **"Loot Balls opened" player statistic** that increases each time the player opens a loot ball.
- **Invisible** Loot Balls **emit tiny sparks that reveal their position**. You can **wax them with honeycomb** to prevent this (**You can only do this in invisible mode**). To undo this, **right-click** with honeycomb again.
