This cobblemon sidemod adds the famous pokÃ©balls with loot from the original games to cobblemon. (**Cobblemon mod is required**)

## Features
### Loot Balls
Loot Balls can contain up to a stack of an item inside. Objects are obtained by **right clicking on the pokeball**.

Loot balls can be found everywhere in the world, but some loot balls are only obtainable under certain conditions. To see more details, check the github docs.

> Some loot balls will spawn invisibly, but they emit tiny sparks, so pay attention!
### Mapmakers
- To set-up a loot, you need to be in **creative mode** and **right-click on the loot ball with the item or stack of an item in your hand**.
- Loot Balls can be invisible. In **creative mode**, right-click on the loot ball with your **empty hand**.
- Players have an **"Loot Balls opened" player statistic** that increases each time the player opens a loot ball.
- **Invisible** Loot Balls **emit tiny sparks that reveal their position**. You can **wax them with honeycomb** to prevent this (**You can only do this with invisible loot balls**). To undo this, **right-click** with honeycomb again.
- Loot Balls can be **waterlogged**.

## Planned features
- Integration with **Lootr** mod to share loot with other players.
- Implement loot ball fishing, archaeology loot balls and chests with loot balls.
- Add animations and decoration for loot ball opening.
