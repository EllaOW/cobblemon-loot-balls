- Critical fix to NBT saving/loading for lootballs.
- Added config file in ```config``` folder with 4 new configurations.
  - From now, you can configure lootballs to allow loot for multiple players.
  - Check the details in the [config docs](https://github.com/ResistorCat/cobblemon-loot-balls/blob/main/docs/Configs.md)
- Added new NBT tags to lootballs for mapmakers:
  - ```Uses```: Indicates the uses remaining in a loot ball. When it reaches 0, the lootball is destroyed.
  - ```Infinite```: Boolean byte that indicates if loot ball has infinite uses.
- Tweaked loot ball generation.
- Added Loot Ball Finder item.
  - Currently, it only helps to find hidden loots within 2 chunks range.
