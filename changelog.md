# Changes
- Generated Loot Balls are now a bit rarer.
- Added 2 new configs:
  - `minLootBallsPerChunk`: You can now set the minimum amount of lootballs generated per chunk. (Defaults to `0`)
  - `generationChance`: You can now set the chance for a lootball generation attempt to be successful. (Defaults to `0.08`)
