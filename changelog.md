# Changes
- Updated all existing loot tables. You can check the new loots in the [lootball docs](https://github.com/ResistorCat/cobblemon-loot-balls/blob/main/docs/Lootballs.md).
- Added **loot ball fishing, archaeology and drop sources**.
- Added 5 new loot balls to natural generation:
  - **Lure**: Obtainable only by **fishing** in cold oceans.
  - **Heal**: **Naturally generated** in biomes with **villages**.
  - **Dive**: **Naturally generated** in oceans at the bottom and by fishing in deep ocean biomes.
  - **Repeat**: Obtainable only by brushing suspicious sand in desert pyramids and wells.
  - **Luxury**: **Naturally generated** in geodes and obtainable by breaking Budding Amethyst.
- Added config file in ```config``` folder with 10 new configurations.
  - From now, you can configure loot balls to allow loot for multiple players (works similar to Lootr mod).
  - You can tweak the **max amount of loot balls generated per chunk**.
  - You can disable loot ball fishing, archaeology, natural generation and other sources.
  - Check the details in the [config docs](https://github.com/ResistorCat/cobblemon-loot-balls/blob/main/docs/Configs.md)
- Added new NBT tags to lootballs for mapmakers:
  - ```Uses```: Indicates the uses remaining in a loot ball. When it reaches 0, the lootball is destroyed.
  - ```Infinite```: Boolean byte that indicates if loot ball has infinite uses.
  - `Multiplier`: Float that indicates the bonus loot multiplier for a loot ball. (defaults to 2.0 for natural hidden loot balls)
- Tweaked loot ball generation and particles.
  - By default, 3 attempts will be made per chunk (configurable) to spawn loot balls.
  - Hidden loot balls will now generate 3 sparks instead of 1.
- Added **Loot Ball Finder** item.
  - Currently, it only helps to find **hidden** loots in a `64x64x64` area centered in the player.
  - It can be obtained by crafting. See the [features docs](https://github.com/ResistorCat/cobblemon-loot-balls/blob/main/docs/Features.md)
  - This is WIP. I appreciate your feedback on discord!
- Updated language files and text formatting.
- Removed unused `doLootBallFishing` gamerule and replaced with a new config.

## Fixes
- **Critical fix** to NBT saving/loading for loot balls.
  - Manually placed loot balls should now remember the items inside correctly.
- Fixed: Loot balls aren't generating in y-levels below 0.
- Fixed: generated hidden loot balls not giving double loot after world reload.
  - **_Only newly generated hidden loot balls will have double loot._**
